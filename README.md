# Link Tracker

Link Tracker is a Chrome extension that allows you to track link clicks and observe the time duration.

## Installation

To install the Link Tracker extension, follow these steps:

1. Download the source code from GitHub.
2. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.
3. Turn on Developer mode.
4. Click on Load unpacked.
5. Select the directory where you downloaded the source code.

## Usage

Once you have installed the extension, simply browse the web as you normally would. Whenever you click on a link, the extension will record the URL of the link and the time duration between the click and the page load. This data is then sent to the background script, which can be configured to send it to your server or store it locally.

## Customization

You can customize the extension to fit your specific needs by modifying the source code. For example, you can change the way the data is sent to the background script, or add additional fields to the data object.
